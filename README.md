## Risk Analyzer

This repository hosts the source code of a startup project I took part in few months ago.
The application requirement was for a supply chain management system that is accessible through a Web browser. 

The users of the application are supply chain managers who in the course of their work need to view and manage information regarding
the network of suppliers for their company. The application supports the following use cases:

1. View the supply chain, i.e. network of suppliers and the target company
2. View information pertaining to a supplier
3. View information pertaining to a target company
4. Update information pertaining to a supplier
5. Update information pertaining to a target company
6. Add a new supplier to the supply chain
7. Add a new target company to the supply chain
8. Delete an existing supplier
9. Delete an existing target company
10. Export the supply chain to XML
11. Import the supply chain from XML
12. View frequency distribution* analysis performed on the supply chain
