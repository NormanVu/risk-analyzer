## Risk Analyzer

This repository hosts the source code of a startup project I took part in few months ago.
The application requirement was for a supply chain management system that is accessible through a Web browser. 

The users of the application are supply chain managers who in the course of their work need to view and manage information regarding
the network of suppliers for their company. The application supports the following use cases:

1. View the supply chain, i.e. network of suppliers and the target company
2. View information pertaining to a supplier
3. View information pertaining to the target company
4. Update information pertaining to a supplier
5. Update information pertaining to the target company
6. Add a new supplier to the supply chain
7. View frequency distribution* analysis performed on the supply chain
